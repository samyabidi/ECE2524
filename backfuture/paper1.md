THE Past, Present, and Future of UNIX

The UNIX operating system was born out of a failed collaboration between MIT, AT&T, and GE in the 60s. From this project the main engineers gathered its best features, a strong programming environment based around an infrastructure that was created through close interaction, and began to create what is today known as UNIX. By 1972, the first fully operation version of UNIX was installed and the world of computing had been forever changed. Fast-forward to present day 2012, and the world of UNIX and LINUX are very different from their humble origins in the early 70s. Many of these advancements were predicted by Raymond in his book, “The Art of Unix Programming”. In particular, his understanding, of where communication, programming communities, and the UNIX LINUX marketplace were moving are for the most part very accurate and it also gave insight into where this influential operating system will be heading in the future.
One of UNIX’s central ideas that developed throughout its early years is the idea of how files, programs, devices, and files on other systems communicate.  In the spirit of simplicity UNIX implementation a system where all objects are treated as text files. Raymond predicted that the original system, the BSD filesystem hierarchy would be the backbone to the future file management systems used by UNIX and LINUX. This proofed to very true with the steady growth of FHS, Filesystem hierarch Standard which is used in all Linux operating systems. It is highly based off of the BSD and still follows the same idea, that software should be “indifferent to whether communicating components were hosted on the same or different machines”. There is also good reason for why this has not changed since Raymond made his predictions and observations. This particular UNIX adaptation was due to the interdiction of inter-computer communication and to this date that is still the complexity of our systems. At the most complex points of communication you are simply reading a file from another computer. So, no revolutionarily new protocol was necessary until UNIX and Linux were forced to more efficiently implement GUIs.
Even though to date the FHS standard has seen large use in the Linux platform it is slowly becoming necessary for a communication protocol which takes advantage of “attaching arbitrary name/value pairs as properties of a filename”. This is necessary to streamline the process of running a GUI through the UNIX or Linux operating system. While UNIX began as a command line operating system the current opinion is that people like graphics. They want to be able to view files, stream video, and manipulate data through a neatly presented graphical user interface. While this mentality was previously held at bay due to low processor capabilities it has now become the norm and I believe that the UNIX and Linux operating systems must adapt or die in the futute. 
Another big area of change for the UNIX environment is the business model under which companies that are involved with it run. UNIX began as an environment developed by university researchers and other very technically savvy people for themselves and their own needs, mostly large scale collaborative programming. As time went on companies began to attempt to license the product in a similar manner to how Microsoft currently licenses its Windows operating system for use as the operating system that servers would run. This was not nearly as successful as had been hoped and almost killed the entire project. Today Linux and UNIX are essentially licensed for free and companies involved make their money through maintenance fees. They keep the servers running, install necessary patches, as well as optimize the operating system for the particular needs of the customer. Raymond also believed that “Open source turns software into a service industry” and his assumption was correct today one of the largest UNIX Linux based companies Red Hat essentially does purely software and infrastructure maintenance. “Red Hat sells subscriptions for the support, training, and integration services that help customers in using open-source software”, in particular Linux and UNIX.
I believe that this model is the one of the future. This is because the most efficient way to make software is through the open-source model. There is no question that the UNIX and Linux environments are some of the most stable for large scale server application, more so than operating systems created at ridiculous prices by companies such as Microsoft. Since this is the case all that is left is the maintenance and optimization of such operating systems. I believe the days of large companies creating the world’s best programs are quickly coming to an end and this movement can be largely attributed to the open-source mentality that UNIX and Linux helped foster. 
When Raymond wrote his predictions and hopes for the future of UNIX and Linux one reoccurring theme regardless of the topic was the GUI. He consistently mentioned how the GUI and the infrastructure to use it through UNIX and Linux was currently lacking but would be one of the areas of largest growth.  This statement might be the most epic and fitting one that Raymond made throughout the futures section of his book.  At the time Linux was already available in the marketplace but had not gained the footing it currently has. Linux was supposed to be a UNIX based operating system which among other additions was to be closely married to a GUI.  Raymond speaks as if operating systems such as this would enjoy grand growth because of the consumer’s current thirst for graphics, simplicity, and neatly displayed information. He could not have been more correct. Linux users have grown at a rate and scale not matched by any other operating system and it is in large part due to the adaptation of a highly functional GUI. 
This GUI revolution has also led to the growth of Linux’s presence in the desktop marketplace. Historically and when Raymond wrote his book, UNIX and Linux’s bread and butter was the server market. There is no doubt, that today things still remain the same but the open source community has slowly began to focus its attention more on the end-user, just as Raymond had predicted. This is highly due to a shift in the demographic of UNIX Linux open source programmers. In the early years most developers were very heavily involved in the academic community and were developing the operating system for their own use in complex server based applications but as time has passed the community has grown increasing full of younger more hobbyist type programmers. These programmers are more interested in generating something to help them do their everyday computer tasks such as viewing and sharing media. This younger generation’s involvement can also be attributed to the growth of the internet and social media, making communication between people in different fields that might have otherwise not crossed paths much easier and natural.
I believe that this mentality will continue to gather steam because more hobbyists are joining the open-source movement than older people. Also demand for an open-source end-user operating system is increasing. This has been clearly shown by a recent linuxinsider study stating that demand for Linux based end-user operating systems is growing at almost 100 percent per annum.
This change has and will continue to alter the way UNIX and Linux programmers perceive the development cycle. Raymond says that in the past UNIX programmers have always considered function over form. Creating programs which run elegantly on the inside at the expense of a sometimes poor user experience; but beginning in the early 2000’s and continuing into the future these same programmers are beginning to take lessons from a philosophy which is almost opposite in nature, that of Apple’s. At Apple GUIs are created first, how GUIs will interact second, and how the low level code will allow these operations to take place third. This results in a perfect user experience, but also code that was pieced together, not neat, and interacts with other code in a less than desirable manner. 
I believe that if UNIX and Linux are to advance to the next level for operating systems, developers must slightly let go of the UNIX philosophy and be willing to consider appearance a little more before function. If UNIX and Linux can do this without losing sight of what has currently made it great then I believe its future may be the brightest of all the operating systems. 
While the technology surrounding computers has clearly advanced, for the sake of what is needed of operating systems communication with files, programs, and other files has stayed relatively the same and will continue to do so. This is why Raymond’s prediction regarding communication was so accurate. The only areas of technological advance which have really shaken up the computer world as Raymond and other UNIX programmers saw it was the assurgency and astronomical growth of the GUI and the personal computer. These two alterations of the status quo resulted in the UNIX community of the 90 to underestimate the importance of the GUI. Raymond on the other hand clearly stated that a better Linux GUI was necessary and would be created. He could not have been more correct in his prediction. Regarding the growth of the end-user market he also felt that there would be growth because both the new open-source community would provide it and the growing personal computer market would demand it. These statements have both been spot on and will continue to be correct. Overall Linux has a very bright future ahead of it. Having already dominated the server operating system market it is beginning to re-shape its ideals to tackle the personal computer market which I believe, with time, it will dominate.
