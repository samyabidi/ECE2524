1.  This assignment is relative to a Unix class because it involves
    using Python, which is heavily used with Linux. Also Linux is
    heavily used for database related work. So learning to work with
    databases inside of it is very useful.
2.  How points should be distributed was described in the actual
    assignment in my case but to go into more depth: Reading data into
    the file will be graded 10 points on functionality and 5 points on
    style. So there is a possibility for partial credit if the student
    does not manage to fully read the file. The 5 points for how
    fitting the storage format is will be completely style. If it is a
    good method for comparing that particular trend then full points
    will be awarded. If not points will be awarded according to how
    fitting it is. The 10 points for analysis will be 5 for style and 5
    for functionality. It is important that it works but at the same
    time it should be elegant and efficient. The 5 bonus points will
    essentially be tacked onto the previous 10 points because the more
    complex the trend the more analysis code there will be.
