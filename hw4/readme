the parts file contains a 5 line system that is repeated
the 1st line is the partid, 2nd is part description, 3rd is footprint and finally 4th is quantity available
the 5th line is a space to denote a seperation between consecutive items.

the action files are all 5 slightly different but follow some conventions
the 1st line of all action files have just a single term, the action which the particular action file executes

in the case of the add function:
the first 4 lines are the different fields of a part seperated by colon with the actual field value

in the case of the remove function
their is a single line which has a field descriptor and its value seperated by colon

in the case of set/update
their are two lines each with a field descriptor and a field value seperated by colon
the first line tells us what field to reset and what value to give it while 
the second line tells us what field of what part we should be looking for and what value it must have 
if we want to reset one of its values

in the case of list
first line is a field descriptor and a value seperated by colon
the program then prints out all parts with that value in the that field descriptor

in the case of sort
the first line is just a field descriptor by which to sort
